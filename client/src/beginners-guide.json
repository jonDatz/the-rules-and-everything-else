After your use one of these methods to determine your Ability scores remember to add the increases to your scores your character got from your Race.  \r\nThe most common method is the rolling method.  You take 4 six sided dice (called d6s) and roll them, then you add together the three highest numbers you rolled and record that sum.  You do this a total of 6 times and then you assign each number to an Ability. \r\nThe next method is the standard array.  This method is the simplest because it is just a set of numbers that you use [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8].  Now just like with rolling you assign those numbers to your Abilities as you like.  \r\nThe last way described in the books is the Point Buy Method.  With point buy the DM will give you a number of points you can spend on your Ability Scores.  The highest number you can buy is 15 and the lowest is 8.  \r\n8 costs 0 points, 9 costs 1, 10 costs 2, 11 costs 3, 12 costs 4, 13 costs 5, 14 costs 7, and 15 costs 9\r\nLet's use the standard array for our Drunken Barbarian.  A Barbarian cares about Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity the most, so we want our highest scores in those spots.  We get an additional +2 to our Strength and Constitution thanks to our Race and Subrace.  Our Ability Scores end up looking like: [Strength = 15, Dexterity = 14, Constitution = 17, Wisdom = 8, Intelligence = 10, Charisma = 12]"

Many people think of Hit Points as literaly that, a numerical representation of how many hits you can take.  That does not have to be the case, your Hit Points can be a measure of how many times you can dodge by a hair or how much grit and determination your character has to keep going.  In combat, your Hit Points will be reduced when an enemy attack or effect causes you damage, but even this can be flavored as you play.  You calculate your maximum Hit Points when you create your character by taking the maximum number from your class's hit dice and adding your constitution modifier.  Then each time you level up you roll your hit die and add your consitution modifier to it and increase your maximum Hit Points by that result.\r\nWhen your Hit Points hit 0 you are knocked unconscious, and begin to make Death Saving throws.  These saving throws are the simplest kind, you roll a d20 and if you get above a 10 you succeed, 10 or lower and you fail.  You make a Death Saving Throw each round when your turn comes up and if you succeed three times you become stabilized and no longer need to make the Death saves.  If you fail three times, however, your character has died.  More dangerously, any time you are dealt damage while unconcious you automatically fail a Death Saving Throw, and if it would be a critical hit you fail 2!  On the bright side, your allies can stabilize you with spells or a medicine check and you no longer need to worry about dying right away.  Even better, if you roll a 20 on a Death Saving throw you gain one Hit Point and are no longer unconcious. That can be a dangerous time, because if you take damage, and after hitting 0 Hit Points the rest of the damage would bring you to half your total Hit Points below 0 that means you have suffered Massive Damage, and your character dies immediately, so beware fighting while low on health. \r\nDeath Saving throws are the least common type of saving throw, hopefully.  When you chose a class it gave you proficiency in two different saves, which means that when the DM asks you to roll one of those saves you get to roll your d20 and add both your proficiency bonus and your Ability Modifier to that roll.  Commonly through combat your character will need to make saves against enemy spells and abilities, the DM will tell you when to roll these saving throws and after your result will tell you whether you passed or failed and any effects that might have occured.  For all saves you get to add the Ability Modifier of that save to your roll, even if it is negative you've gotta."

When you are rolling a d20 (whether for an attack, a save, or anything else) and you have advantage, you simply roll your die twice and use the higher roll.  For disadvantage you roll twice but must use the lower number.  Some situations may result in your having both Advantage and Disadvantage at once, in that case you only roll once.  Finally, no matter how many times you have advantage or disadvantage you only roll twice, and regardless of if you have advantage six times and disadvantage once it still means you only roll once."

When making an Ability check it will be described either as an Ability (Skill) check or sometimes simply as a Skill check (for example: a Wisdom (perception) check or just a perception check).  This tells you what Ability Modifier to use when calculating your total as well as what skill the check is to determine whether you can add your proficiency bonus or not.\r\nTo calculate your total roll your d20 then add the appropriate Ability Modifier and then, if you are proficient in the skill, add your proficiency bonus.  Tell the DM your total score and they will tell you what happens as a result of that score."

If you want to do a voice and speak as if you were your character do it.  If you just want to describe how your character speaks or does soemthing go for it.  Whatever lets you and your friends enjoy the game is what you should do.  \r\nSome DM's might award players for Roleplaying well, and others might not.  Make sure to talk to your DM about what the group expects in terms of Roleplaying and what your level of comfort is with that.  It's a game, it's meant to be fun."

As with a lot of the flavor we've run into so far, these things are there to help flesh out your character.  The most important thing is YOUR concept for the character, if something in the background doesn't feel right then have a chat with your DM and you'll probably be able to work together to find or create something that feels right.\r\nThe personality traits weren't the only things your background gives you.  You also gain some items and proficiencies that can help define your character even further.  Finally, most backgrounds will grant a background Feature.  These features are primarily not going to have mechanical effects.  These sorts of Features are often called 'Ribbon Abilities.'  They will quite often give you something like a hint of where to find information or allow you to find a NPC that may help you."
